ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Gopi Gor. 

I'm currently doing my MS in Cybersecurity at Fordham University, NY. 

The different repositories have some of my originally written scripts, 
and the readme files have a description and explanation of the code that I have created for different kinds of automation use cases.
