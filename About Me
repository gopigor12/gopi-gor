ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Gopi Gor. 

I'm currently doing my MS in Cybersecurity at Fordham University, NY. 

The different repositories have some of my originally written scripts, 
and the files have a description with the brief explanation of the code that I have created for different kinds of automation use cases. 

You can find bash, sql, and python scripts in the different folders, for red team and blue team. 
Corresponding reports for each code can be find in the folders too.
